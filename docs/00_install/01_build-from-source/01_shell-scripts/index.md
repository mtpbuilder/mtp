[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the MTPIO software and dependencies.

To build MTPIO from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download MTPIO Source](01_download-mtpio-source.md)
2. [Build MTPIO Binaries](02_build-mtpio-binaries.md)
3. [Install MTPIO Binaries](03_install-mtpio-binaries.md)
4. [Test MTPIO Binaries](04_test-mtpio-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall MTPIO](05_uninstall-mtpio.md)

[[info | Building MTPIO is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to MTPIO, it is recommended that you install the [MTPIO Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
