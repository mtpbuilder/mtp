content_title: Build MTPIO from Source
---

[[info | Building MTPIO is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to MTPIO, it is recommended that you install the [MTPIO Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

MTPIO can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build MTPIO using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | MTPIO Installation Recommended]]
| After building MTPIO successfully, it is highly recommended to install the MTPIO binaries from their default build directory. This copies the MTPIO binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/mtpio/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the MTPIO release version.
